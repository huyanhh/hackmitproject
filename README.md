## Ultimate Lights

**HackMIT 2016**

Have you ever woken up in the morning in total darkness or with lights that are too bright?

Have you ever gotten up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, only to fumble around for the light switch?

Have you ever been late leaving your home to an event, despite all of the alarms that you set on your phone?

**Ultimate Lights** is here as a solution for all of those problems and more!

Picture your ceiling covered by a grid of LED lights. Wouldn't it be great if those lights knew your schedule and where you were in the house at all times? Well wish no more! 

We at **Ultimate Lights** have prototyped a unique software implementation of a smart LED grid system that has the capability to "follow" you around the house by turning on the lights directly above you and in your path, and turning off lights behind you. The system can also be set to gradually turn on and off as you wake up and as you go to sleep, and also has an alarm mode that causes the lights to flash continuously when you need to leave the house to get somewhere!

Ultimate Lights has an easy to use user interface that allows users to set a schedule for their Ultimate Light system so that the system knows when to set off timing alarms, and when the lights should follow you around the house.

Ultimate Lights utilizes an Angular.JS front-end framework in conjunction with a Python backend, a Node web server, and Firebase to update our interface across machines in real time.

Thanks for taking the time to read our submission!
